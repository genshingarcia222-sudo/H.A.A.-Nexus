# Baseline

The latest verified repository state is in the block below. Every baseline
ever recorded here is kept in **History**, newest first. Entries are appended
and never overwritten.

A baseline counts as verified only when the commands were actually run against
that exact commit on a named device. A figure copied from somewhere else is not
a baseline.

Earlier checkpoints, from before this file existed, are recorded in
`CHANGELOG.md`, each with its own verification paragraph. For example,
`docs/DECISION_REGISTER.md` records 478 tests green at `aeb56d6`. They are
preserved there, not copied here.

## History

### B-002 — sync protocol established — `1d7b209` — 2026-09-23 — DEVICE-01

The tree at `1d7b209307e7f2a2490cd113116e65052aada980`, on branch
`nexus/sync-bootstrap` tracking `origin/main` (N-002), verified in full on
DEVICE-01. This is the first baseline that includes `.nexus/` and
`tools/nexus-sync/`.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | `npx --yes pnpm@9 -r test` | nexus-core **390/390**, desktop **228/228** |
| Preflight tool | `node tools/preflight/preflight.test.mjs` | **17/17** |
| Sync tool | `node tools/nexus-sync/nexus-sync.test.mjs` | **60/60** |
| Typecheck | `npx --yes pnpm@9 -r typecheck` | clean |
| Build | `npx --yes pnpm@9 -r build` | clean |
| Rust | `cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | **55/55**, rustc 1.98.1 |

**Mutation verification:** eleven mutations of `nexus-sync.mjs`, all killed, no
survivor, run against a scratch copy from this tree. One mutation initially
reported NOT APPLIED (its target had moved) and one failed to match CRLF line
endings; both were corrected and re-run until they killed.

**Unchanged from B-001.** The application counts are identical to the
pre-bootstrap baseline `865d31e`: this work added tooling and documentation and
changed no application behaviour.

**What is not covered.** The `.nexus/` state commits that follow this one
(`release`, the `finalize` sync record) touch only `.nexus/` state files. The
sync tool's own suite validates those files and was re-run after them; the
application suites were not, because no application file changes.

### B-001 — pre-bootstrap baseline — `865d31e` — 2026-09-21 — DEVICE-01

The state of `main` immediately before the distributed-workstation sync system
was added. It was recorded so that the bootstrap itself can be audited.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Git | `git status`, `git rev-list --left-right --count main...origin/main` | clean; `0 0` after `git fetch origin` |
| Tests | `npx --yes pnpm@9 -r test` | nexus-core **390/390**, desktop **228/228** |
| Preflight tool | `node tools/preflight/preflight.test.mjs` | **17/17** |
| Typecheck | `npx --yes pnpm@9 -r typecheck` | clean |
| Build | `npx --yes pnpm@9 -r build` | clean |
| Rust | `cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | **55/55**, rustc 1.98.1 |

Notes: `desktop` emits expected stderr from `saveFailureRecovery.test.tsx`
(simulated write failure), and the test passes.
